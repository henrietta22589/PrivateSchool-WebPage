# Private School WebPage
The aim of this project was to create from scratch a Private School's page in order to practice my HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap skills as well as have a little bit of fun coding :)

In order to see the webpages, please extract the .zip file. 
If you want to check out how the webpages look (Vanilla JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Boostrap) click here: https://github.com/henrietta22589/PrivateSchool-WebPage/blob/main/WebSite%20Printscreens.pdf

P.S. this is an exercise from The C# PeopleCert Bootcamp, a 6-month course (500 hrs) that aims to provide a complete path for students to go from zero to employed as web developers while working with other students along the way. Check this out: (https://peoplecerteducation.org/bootcamp/)
